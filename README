R code for data analysis for Case Study 1 can be found in the folder titled "01. MAIN DATA ANALYSIS".

The file "Analysis.R" is the code for loading and cleaning the data. You must run this file first.
The file "Analysis 2.R" is the code for our sttatistical analysis and modeling.

The code for the loops we used to search for the best possible ARIMA models are in the file
titled "optimize_arima.R". Run this code with great caution as it will take an extremely long time to run 
these for loops. It took me several hours to run this code.

The "Analysis.R" and "Analysis 2.R" code should not give you any trouble. They run through in a few minutes.

The R code used to optimize the parameters for chill days and heating days can be found in the folder
titled "Phenology Model-GDD". The files used to optimze the parameters that we used in our final model 
are found in the files titled: "DC10_par.R", "KY10_par.R", and "L10_par".
All the other files in this folder can be ignored.
You do not need to run this code to run the "Analysis.R" or "Analysis 2.R" code.

Data for our analysis and all our modeling can be found in the "data" folder.

The slides from our presentation can be found in the "Presentation" folder.
